        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Art, for me, is a different state of being where one focuses on the small beautiful intricate things in life. Like the way light hits glass objects on a window sill, or the sensation of a lady bug crawling across your hand. In my life, I tend to reflect so much on the past I believe it can become a destructive force, and a distraction from the present. Because of this, art is the perfect escape to see beauty in the moment. The mental envelopment involved in art helps ground me to the here and now.

        My current concentration is in small scale metal fabrication. I love the concept of someone wearing my piece as an expression of their own self. Jewelry design is a unique way to gain exposure in art because it adorns a living moving canvas that intersects with different people and places in a day to day life. Designing for the physical body makes the process all the more profound for me. I want my art to spark conversation and connect people together, and I think jewelry is the perfect way to do that.
        <br>
        <br>
        My goal is to continue on my current path of self-exploration and self-comprehension in order to get to a place where I can then give back to my community. Art is the  most authentic form of self expression, and I take notice of its ability to improve the life of the individual, and then in turn the whole. I believe art can be a catalyst for social change.</p>
